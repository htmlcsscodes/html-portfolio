<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Sania SAEL. I was born  in a town called Port-Salut, located in the southern part of Haiti. I am the eldest of a family of two children. My father is an economist by profession, my mother is a dress maker. 
  My parents raised me with love and honesty. They taught me to love the people around me and to treat them the way I would love to be treated. My father particularly taught me to give my best in everything I undertake; he taught me to never settle for
   less than what I deserve and to always keep in mind that the impossible could become possible if I really believe in it and put in the effort. I remember he often told me that there is no greater pride than to taste the fruits of oneâ€™s hard work. 
   Those words have been a guidance for me throughout my entire life. They helped me overcome obstacles and keep working on my goals, even when the most unfortunate circumstances took me by storm.  </p>
  <p>Studious, visionary and full of ambition, I am one those who believe that success is in the effort and that one must always aim for excellence, no matter how far you have come from. That is why, at school I always worked hard 
  and did my best to be among the best students of my class. Throughout my years in high school, I took part in many extracurricular activities, including debates, speech competitions, and so on, which allowed me to open up to the world and 
  develop my communication skills. I am passionate about reading, music and painting. I remember spending all my free time in high school singing, drawing and writing. This passion for music and book took me to write my first book at the age of 15 and 
  to participate in many text competitions. My academic performances enabled me to integrate a non-profit organization that rewards students with a excellent academic records. With them, I had the opportunity to carry out numerous voluntary works that 
  consisted of visiting orphanages, helping the people that are in need and try put a smile on their lips, by making them feel they are important.
